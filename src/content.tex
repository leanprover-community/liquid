\subsection{What is the Liquid Tensor Experiment?}

A collaborative project to formally verify parts of condensed mathematics,
a new subject developed by Dustin Clausen and Peter Scholze.
We use a computer program called Lean,
in which we enter all the definitions, theorems and proofs,
upon which Lean checks the mathematics down to the axioms.

The name ``Liquid Tensor Experiment'' is a homage
to the progressive rock band Liquid Tension Experiment,
as well as a reference to the liquid mathematics that is formalized in this project.

\subsection{How it all started}

In December 2020, Peter Scholze published a blogpost:
\url{https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2020/12/05/liquid-tensor-experiment/}.
In this blogpost, he challenged the proof assistant communities
to formally verify one of the main results of his lecture notes on
Analytic Geometry, \url{www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Analytic.pdf}.

In the Lean community, we took up this challenge.
Within half a year, we reached the first major milestone.
Scholze wrote about his experiences in a follow-up blogpost,

\subsection{Where can I learn more about Lean?}

A good place to start is \url{https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html}.
There is also a Zulip chatroom, where there is always a helpful person to say hello and help you along,
\url{https://leanprover.zulipchat.com}.

\subsection{Liquid Tensor Experiment in the media}

Recently our project was mentioned in various media.
You can read about it in Nature,
